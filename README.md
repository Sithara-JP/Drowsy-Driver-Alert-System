# Drowsy-Driver-Alert-System
This proposed Image processing approach has three stages: detecting Face, detecting Eyes and detecting drowsiness. Face detection is employed to locate the regions of the driver's eyes, which are used as the templates for eye tracking in subsequent frames. Finally, the tracked eye images are used for drowsiness detection in order to generate warning alarms. Thus, the proposed approach for real-time driver drowsiness detection is an effective solution method.
