# Drowsy-Driver-Alert-System 
The objective of this project is to propose a drowsiness detection system that will detect whether a driverâ€™s eyes are closed for a few seconds while driving and will alert the driver. 

This proposed Digital Image processing approach has three stages: detecting Face, detecting Eyes and detecting drowsiness. Face detection is employed to locate the regions of the driver's eyes, which are used as the templates for eye tracking in subsequent frames. Finally, the tracked eye images are used for drowsiness detection in order to generate warning alarms.
